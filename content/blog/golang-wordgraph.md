This post will talk about how we can use Golang to generate a wordgraph. In a previous [post](https://www.cameronroberts.dev/blog/golang-twitter-scraper/) we talked about how we can use the Twitter API to scrape tweets. We are going to build on that in this post by analalyzing those tweets to extract the most popular words and plotting that on to a wordgraph. If you haven't read that post then it might help out but if not don't worry we will cover the code in this tutorial.

### Prerequisites
- A valid Golang installation. If you don't have this then this is a good place to [start](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- Twitter developer account. https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard
- Some basic programming knowledge but I'll do my best to explain the examples

### Twitter API key
If you haven't already got a developer account on Twitter you will need to sign up. The steps to do this are documented [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access). 

Once you have an approved developer account head over to the [dashboard](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) and create a new `Project`.

Take note of your API key, API key secret, access token, access token secret as we will need these in a few moments time.


### Project setup 

```bash
mkdir twitter-bot
cd twitter-bot
// Change this to your Github
go mod init github.com/cameronldroberts/golang-wordgraph
```


### 3..2..1.. Go!
Open the `golang-wordgraph` directory in your favourite text editor and create a file called `main.go`. 

Firstly we will focus on authenticating with twitter. We are going to store the keys in environment variables. Itâ€™s not a good idea to have sensitive information stored in our code as when it reaches our source control (Github, Gitlab, etc) it may be visible to others.

Grab the API keys and tokens from your [twitter developer dashboard](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard). The four values needed are `CONSUMER_KEY`, `CONSUMER_SECRET`, `ACCESS_TOKEN` and `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`.
```bash
export CONSUMER_KEY=<API_KEY_VALUE>
export CONSUMER_SECRET=<API_KEY_SECRET_VALUE>
export ACCESS_TOKEN=<ACCESS_TOKEN_VALUE>
export ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=<ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET_VALUE>
```


Now that we have the environment variables exported we are ready to start writing some Golang! To start lets begin with the following code.

```go
package main
import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

type Credentials struct {
	ConsumerKey       string
	ConsumerSecret    string
	AccessToken       string
	AccessTokenSecret string
}

func main() {
	creds := Credentials{
		ConsumerKey:       os.Getenv("CONSUMER_KEY"),
		ConsumerSecret:    os.Getenv("CONSUMER_SECRET"),
		AccessToken:       os.Getenv("ACCESS_TOKEN"),
		AccessTokenSecret: os.Getenv("ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET"),
	}
}
```

We import some of the core packages, create a struct to hold our credentials and populate it with the values from the env vars we just exported.
